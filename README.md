# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

## Module 5 Challenge

Deployed webpage: https://noah138.github.io/module-5-challenge/

# Description

The request for this project was to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. The app runs in browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. Moment.js was also utilized. When the webpage is opened by a user, the current day is displayed at the top. When the user scrolls down, there are presented with blocks in increments of 1 hour from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Hours of the day in the past are colored in grey, the current hour is colored in red, and the future hours of the day are colored in green. Once an event is typed into an hourly block, pressing the save button in the according row will save that event, even upon page refreshing.
